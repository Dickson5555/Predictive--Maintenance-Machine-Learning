# Predictive-Maintenance-for-Mine Trucks And Drilling Machines

  ## PROJECT OVERVIEW🔥
   ### Mining operations rely heavily on haul trucks and drilling machines.
  ###  Unexpected breakdowns causes:
   ###  ~ Production delays
   ###  ~ High repair cost 
   ### ~ Lost revenue( downtime in large mines = thousands of dollars/hours)
  ### 👁️The goal of this project is to use maintenance logs (hours operated,breaakdowns history,service dates)
  ### to predict when equipment might fail .This allows proactive scheduling of maintenance, reducing downtime and cost.🪓

  # Exploratory Data Analysis🔍
  ### 🔗 Machines with > 500 hours show 30% higher failure risk.
  ### 🔗 Frequent breakdowns reduce future machine survival time.
  ### 🔗 Long service intervals( many days since service) increase risk.

  # 💼 Business Impact 
  ### 🔗 Proactive maintenance: identify machines likely to fail soon and service them before breakdown.
  ### 🔗 Reduced downtime : Even a 10% reduction in failures could save a mid-size mine $ 1M+ annually.💲
  ### 🔗 Optimized resources allocation : Prioritize maintenance crews where risk is highest💀.
